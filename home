    <h2>Study Skills</h2>
    <p>Throughout the past classes of study skils we learned many different ways how to study,
        using different ways to study material and use it. Ranging from tests, to homework, and
        for studying. We used charts, how to takes tests, and takeing notes. Using this information
        I can do what I want for a job, optimally I want to work in software development or cyber
        security. Note taking is vital for doing this as code is like learning a different language
        as note taking would help alot. I am also studying for the intrest of hacking. That is a
        cool subject I could learn and helps with cyber security. You could use the bubble graph or 
        something simular to do this. My dream is to make a living wroking for a big name company
        such as facebook, discord, or Twitter. Something that would be fun and enjoyable to learn
        work as. Or I could start my own buisness and build from the groud up. Working as a software
        developer or for cyber securtiy is also high paying and enjoyable for me. Now I juset have 
        to work towrds it and make it come true.</p>

        <p>"Picaso didnt become picaso in a day" (I wont learn the material in a day. I have to work
            towards it to become the next picaso.)</p>
        <p>"Never say never"</p>

    <p> Even when it gets hard dont give up.</p>
